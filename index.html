            <time>11 Oct 2023</time>
            <p> The article suggests smart interaction design should focus on Artifical Intelligence(AI)'s ability to collect its own data instead of consume exisiting data <br> 
                via three steps, namely Reception, Interpretation and Learning. <br>
                Reception examples include Tesla's semi-self-driving cars and Waymo car, while intrepretation refers to the processing system like GPU for idetifying road conditions during self-driving. <br>
                The last step is to learn human experiences via labelling to specify the expected outcomes. <br>
                To conclude, the writer comments that AI is not just about creating the most powerful machine learning algorithm but rather focusing on human interaction in between.</p>
