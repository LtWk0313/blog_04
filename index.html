            <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/smart-interaction-design-is-the-proper-way-to-solve-the-learning-problem-in-ai-bdf989f433cb"> Smart Interaction Design</a>
            <time>11 Oct 2023</time>
            <p> The article suggests smart interaction design should focus on Artifical Intelligence(AI)'s ability to collect its own data instead of consume exisiting data <br> 
                via three steps, namely Reception, Interpretation and Learning. <br>
                Reception examples include Tesla's semi-self-driving cars and Waymo car, while intrepretation refers to the processing system like GPU for idetifying road conditions during self-driving. <br>
                The last step is to learn human experiences via labelling to specify the expected outcomes. <br>
                To conclude, the writer comments that AI is not just about creating the most powerful machine learning algorithm but rather focusing on human interaction in between.</p>

            <time>18 Oct 2023</time>
            <p> The article lists 4 museums to support key elements in interactive immersive art, namely own exhibition mobile app, video components, box-like theaters in exhibition venues, <br>
            generative art, gaming, visitors voting, floral light installation, purple Ganzfeld and so on. <br>
            Teamlab from Japan has been a pioneer in promoting immersive art, while Virtual Reality (VR) with 3D mapping projection system in Van Gogh Exhibition also bring a new practice to the industry. <br>
            Vistors enjoy the benefits of having an interactive journey and new accessible means for viewing famous arts. Meanwhile, complaints towards the art collectiveâ€™s intellectual property for reproduction of art also exist. <br> 
            To sum up, immersive exhibition is a response towards the new technology and a societal movement towards experiences over material things. The writer suggests that immersive art will be an irresistible trend. </p>

            <time>1 Nov 2023</time>
            <p> The article suggests that geospatial Visualization can improve decision making and Identification of patterns and trends. <br> 
            Visualization can be done by Python, JavaScript, or the Google Maps API libraries for creating interactive maps with <br>
            methods like point map, heat map, hexagonal binning map and so on illustrating location, density and spatial relationships in an interactive way. <br> 
            Whether using customize or templated ones depending on the progress, if data is in JSON file, Leaflet's built-in functions can add data to map while customized interactive elements can be added on that.  </p>
